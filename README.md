# COOKIE-DOUGH-Ultra

An updated version of the original exploit Cookie Dough, as the other one required bookmarklets, DNS or inspect. This is much better needing neither.

Currently works on these extensions:

Hapara ✅
IMTLazarus ✅
others to be discovered 

Have one extension that can be used with innerHTML exploit? Tell it!

This'll surely spread quickly due to the fact it's able to be iframed on any site.
